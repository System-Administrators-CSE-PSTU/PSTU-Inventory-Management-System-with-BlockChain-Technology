# PSTU Inventory Management System with Blockchain Technology

![Project Banner](frontend/public/screenshots/banner.png)

> A full‑stack Inventory Management System built for **Patuakhali Science & Technology University (PSTU)** that integrates a lightweight blockchain module to provide an immutable audit trail for critical inventory actions (stock-in, stock-out, approvals and dead-stock entries).

**Live deployment:** [https://stock.pstu.ac.bd](https://stock.pstu.ac.bd) — currently used by PSTU authority.

## Project Overview

This project is an Inventory Management System tailored for institutions that need traceable, auditable changes to inventory data. It provides:

* Centralized CRUD for items, suppliers, departments, offices and users.
* Request and approval workflow for stock movements (stock-in / stock-out).
* Dead-stock tracking and reporting.
* Exportable reports and dashboards for administrators.
* A SHA‑256 hash–based blockchain-style audit mechanism that stores chained hashes of important transactions for tamper‑evidence.

**Used in production:** The application is deployed at `https://stock.pstu.ac.bd` and is currently in use by PSTU authority. Update environment configs and access controls before deploying elsewhere.

## Tech Stack

* Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Node.js, Express
* Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
* Blockchain: SHA‑256 hash–chained audit trail
* Auth: JWT-based (role middleware)

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v18+
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB (Atlas or local)

### Environment Variables

For local development, create `.env` in `backend/`:

````env
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster
DNS_SERVERS=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8
PORT=5000
BLOCKCHAIN_SIGNING_KEY=your_signing_key
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

````

For frontend (`frontend/.env`):

````env
PORT=3000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
````

For production, keep `backend/.env.production` and `frontend/.env.production` as templates only, then set the real values in your hosting environment or cPanel Node app settings. Use:

````env
BACKEND_URL=https://api.stock.pstu.ac.bd
FRONTEND_URL=https://stock.pstu.ac.bd
BACKEND_URL=https://api.stock.pstu.ac.bd
FRONTEND_URL=https://stock.pstu.ac.bd
````

### Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev    # or `node server.js`
```

### Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Backend — API Reference (common endpoints)

> Adapt these to match your actual route names.

* `POST /api/auth/login` — Login; returns JWT
* `GET /api/users/get` — List users (admin)
* `POST /api/users/create` — Create user (admin)
* `GET /api/items/get` — List items (supports `?q`, `?page`)
* `POST /api/items/create` — Create item (admin)
* `PUT /api/items/:id` — Update item
* `GET /api/stockins/get` — List stock-in records
* `POST /api/stockins/create` — Create stock-in (updates inventory + adds block)
* `POST /api/stockouts/create` — Create stock-out (reduces inventory + adds block)
* `GET /api/requests` — Get requests by status
* `POST /api/requests/:id/approve` — Approve request
* `POST /api/deadstocks/create` — Record dead/obsolete item
* `GET /api/blockchain/blocks` — Get block list
* `POST /api/blockchain/verify` — Verify blockchain integrity
.

## Data Models (summary)

* **User**: `{ _id, name, email, passwordHash, role: ['admin','user'], departmentId, isActive }`
* **Item**: `{ _id, name, sku, category, quantity, minQuantity, supplierId, location, unit }`
* **Supplier**: `{ _id, name, contact, email, address }`
* **Request**: `{ _id, itemId, requestedBy, quantity, purpose, status, approvedBy, approvedAt }`
* **StockRecord**: `{ _id, itemId, type:['in','out'], qty, createdBy, remarks, referenceId }`
* **DeadStock**: `{ _id, itemId, quantity, reason, recordedBy, approved }`
* **Block**: `{ index, timestamp, dataHash, previousHash, hash, data }`

## Blockchain Integration — how it works

This system uses a **SHA‑256 hash–based blockchain-style audit mechanism**, not a traditional file-based distributed blockchain.

### How it works

1. When a critical action occurs (stock-in, stock-out, request approval, dead-stock entry), the backend creates a structured transaction payload.
2. The payload is hashed using the **SHA‑256 algorithm**.
3. Each record stores:

   * `currentHash` (SHA‑256 of current data)
   * `previousHash` (hash of the previous transaction)
4. These hashes are chained logically, creating an **immutable sequence of records**.
5. Any modification to historical data breaks the hash chain and is immediately detectable during verification.

### What this is (and is not)

* Tamper‑evident audit trail
* Lightweight and fast (no mining, no consensus overhead)
* Suitable for institutional inventory systems
* Not a decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain
* No proof‑of‑work or peer‑to‑peer consensus

### Verification

* The blockchain page recalculates SHA‑256 hashes and compares them with stored values.
* If any hash mismatch is found, the system flags the record as **tampered**.

**Why this approach was chosen:**
It provides blockchain‑like integrity guarantees while remaining simple, performant, and practical for real‑world university inventory management.

## User Flows (short)

**Stock-out (user → admin)**

1. User creates a stock-out request.
2. Admin approves; quantity is reduced; stock-out record created; a block is appended.

**Dead-stock**

1. Item flagged as dead with details.
2. Admin approves; record created and a block appended.

## Testing & Troubleshooting

* MongoDB connection fails: check `MONGO_URI` and network.
* JWT errors: confirm `JWT_SECRET` is consistent.
* Port conflicts: set `PORT` in `.env` or update dev scripts.
* Blockchain verify: `GET /api/blockchain/blocks` then `POST /api/blockchain/verify`.

---

## Roadmap & TODOs

* Add finer-grained role-based UI permissions
* Add unit/integration tests (Jest / Supertest)
* Harden blockchain: digital signatures, remote storage, or peer replication
* Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility
